Here is a collation of links to useful BehaviourTree resources I have found when trying to use BehaviourTree in one's project.

## **Why?**

This collation is meant to provide a straightforward manner of listing out the resources I frequently refer to when developing Behaviour Tree-driven robotic applications in ROS 2.

## **References**

- [BehaviourTree.CPP Official Documentations](https://www.behaviortree.dev/)

Useful for reading up quickly on what BehaviourTree.CPP is all about and get started.

### **API Documentations**

- [BehaviourTree.CPP V4 API Documentations](https://behaviortree.github.io/BehaviorTree.CPP/)

Useful for understanding the specific CPP function calls to the `BehaviourTree.CPPv4` library.

- [BehaviourTree.CPP V3 API Documentations](https://cardboardcode.github.io/HowToSetUpBehaviourTreeCPPv3APIDocs/)

Useful for understanding the specific CPP function calls to the `BehaviourTree.CPPv3` library.

### **ROS-based Examples**

- [BehaviourTree.ROS2](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS2)

Useful when getting `behaviortree_ros2` **ROS 2** package for BT-driven interaction via ROS 2 actions and services which have non-trivial implementations.

- [BehaviourTree.ROS1](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS)

Useful when getting `behaviortree_ros` **ROS 1** package for BT-driven interaction via ROS 1 actions and services.

### **White Papers**

- [Behavior Trees in Robotics and AI: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00084)
