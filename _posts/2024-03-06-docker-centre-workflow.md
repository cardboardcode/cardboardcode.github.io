In my experience developing software within a team, **standardization of environment dependencies has always been a constant pain**. There had been **countless instances** where trying to get more hands onboard resulted in **more intense bouts of stress**, rather than actually resolving the issue at hand. 

This often comes in the form of teammates being unable to set up a project's complex network of software dependencies which would likely conflict with their own workstation's existing dependencies. **While it is easier to manage such conflicts within python environments, the same cannot be said for C++ libraries as well as lower-level hardware-centric backends like Nvidia's CUDA.** Usually, the workarounds would be a quick dirty hack to switch different versions around while the simpler option would be to completely remove and install the required versions tediously.

Therefore, this article hopes to **address this issue** of environment standardization through **an intuitive use of Docker**.
