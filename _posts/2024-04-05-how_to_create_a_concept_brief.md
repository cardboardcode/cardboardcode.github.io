In this article, you can learn about an essential tool concept artists use in character and environment designs. Having learnt this directly from industry professionals, I would like to share it with others because concept briefs are inexpensive but extremely valuable techniques to minimize distractions given the current social media landscape as well as provide clear visualizations towards a desired end-goal as artists.

A concept brief is a document typically used in entertainment design (Eg. Video Games, Films, TV Shows) as a roadmap for creators, outlining the core idea, target audience, and desired mood for a fictional character or environment.

Here's what an example of it looks like:
