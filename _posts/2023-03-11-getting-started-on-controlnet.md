In an exploration for an ethical use case of AI-generated art, this article dives in-depth about a workflow any artist can use to quickly get started using Stable Diffusion and more critically generate their own models with only their own datasets that they would accumulate over time through their own efforts. The ultimate goal is to strike a balance between proliferating the use of AI tools to alleviate an artist workload and not commiting art theft of other artists. Stable Diffusion has a lot of potential to change the art scene for the better with artists 10 times more likely to fall into depression from burnout. However, it has just as much potential in its adverse effects as seen with the recent anti-AI protests on ArtStation and ensuing bombardment of legal suits against StabilityAI.
