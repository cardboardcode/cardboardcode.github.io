This article is about **comparing between two popular image editors** on opposite side of the premium wall spectrum. As a user of both, here is a list of comparisons that may be useful in understanding what the subtle, yet critical differences that distinguishes both editors. I am more biased towards using Krita due to its open-source nature. However, as you will shortly see, there are still advantages the premium Photoshop still holds over its alternatives, preserving its long-standing title as industry standard digital art tool.

Here are a few key differences: 

| **Krita** | **Photoshop** |
|----------|----------|
| Free | Cost $13.26 per month[1].|
| Available on Windows/Linux/Andriod/IOS | Available only on Windows/MacOS |
| Flexible customised keyboard shortcuts | Only allows customised keyboard shortcuts that requires `Shift`, `Alt`, `Ctrl`|
| Does not support Smart Object Editing | Supports Smart Object Editing (Allows less destructive editing) |
| Allows ease of attachment for reference image beside main canvas | Steep learning curve for attaching images beside main canvas |
