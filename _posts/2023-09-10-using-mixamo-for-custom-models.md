## **Why Learn This?**
Useful for posing characters in your scene constructed in Blender. While you can pose a rigged character yourself, the process can still be inaccurate, time-consuming and tedious, especially when there needs to be multiple characters. Mixamo is an online Adobe platform that provides free MoCAP animation for 3D models. As a user, you can get started using Mixamo's library of default generic 3D models or you can upload your own for the platform to automatically rig it for you.

The aim of this article is to capture my specific unique workflow when using Mixamo.
