This article is aimed at **providing its own standalone but supplementary information** to existing documentations regarding Open Robotics's Robot Middleware Framework (**RMF**).

While the documentation of RMF is comprehensive, readers or developers may still encounter confusion trying to getting an immediate first-hand experience on RMF and how it works by simply following it due to several ambiguous portion of Open Robotic's instructions. Therefore, by writing this article, a relatively more fool-proof method of getting started with RMF Demos can be achieved for any new ROS 2 developers working with the award-winning open-source software.

> Eg. In its suggestion for the use of `rocker` (https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf), it did not specify what command to run to get any of the demos running while not worrying about adhering to necessary environment dependencies. As a result, readers like me are left wondering what other actions need to be taken to simply get started. Furthermore, the instructions to get started using DOcker has the codebase running headless without graphical form which defeats the purpose of getting started and understanding when none can be visualised by anyone following the document.
